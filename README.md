# *XYZReader*

**XYZReader** is an Android application that displays articles in a fancy way. I redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines* and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

*Material Design guidelines: http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* [ ] App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main activity.
* [ ] App theme extends from AppCompat.
* [ ] App uses an app bar and associated toolbars.
* [ ] App provides a Floating Action Button (FAB) for the most common action(s).
* [ ] App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
* [ ] App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* [ ] App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* [ ] App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* [ ] App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
